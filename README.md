# Predicting-Heart-Disease-with-Binary-Logistic-Regression
Statistics for Data Science

<p align="center"><project-description></p>
This project aims to predict whether or not someone will be diagnosed with heart disease using various features and logistic regression. 

### Introduction
Heart disease was the leading cause of death for men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States in 2017. Wouldn‚Äôt it be interesting if we could create a model to predict whether or not someone will be diagnosed with heart disease using A few known key risk factors are high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking. There are several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices that can put someone at a higher risk for heart disease.

### Research Questions
1.	Looking at the variables in the data set, what are the elements?
2.	How would you describe the distributions?
3.	Perform a covariance matrix and describe the results.
4.	What is the best type of correlation test to perform and what do the results mean?
5.	Compare all variables using a correlation matrix. What does this tell you about the data?
6.	Fit a logistic model to the data set that predicts whether or not the person is diagnosed with heart disease.
7.	Which variables had the greatest effect on diagnosis?
8.	Using the data set to predict the outcome, what is the accuracy of the model?
9.	How does the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier compare to the nearest neighbor‚Äôs algorithm?

### Approach
To begin, I will identify each variable and create histograms in order to check for normality in the distribution. I plan to check the correlation between heart disease diagnosis and each variable using a correlation matrix. My approach to the problem is to use logistic regression to predict whether or not someone will be diagnosed with heart disease. I will identify which variables have the greatest effect on being diagnosed with heart disease. Using the logistic regression classifier and the nearest neighbor, I will calculate the accuracy of the model and compare and contrast the differences in accuracy.
How Does the Approach Address (fully or partially) the Problem? The approach described above should address all relationships between the variables in the data set and whether or not the patient was diagnosed with heart disease. I hope to create a model which will predict whether or not a patient will be diagnosed based on the variables included in the data set.
Data
The data set that I will be using for this project can be found at the following link The original source of this data set can be found at this link The data set that I will be using is a subset of 14 attributes from the original source referenced above. The data set contains the following 14 attributes: age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (true or false, 1 or 0), resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina (yes or no, 1 or 0), depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3), thal (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect), diagnosis of heart disease (yes or no, 1 or 0).

## Built With

- RStudio

## Future Updates
Some questions for the future that I hope to answer along the way, as I make my way through this project are whether the data is normalized or needs additional transformation, as well as if any data points are influential or outliers. What happens to the accuracy of the model when I use a different k value for the nearest neighbor calculation?
